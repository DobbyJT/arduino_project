# We-the-system

This repository is made for the project of the Microprocessor Application System Project.

In this project we're using hiwonder ackerman steering.

We'll be doing Regenerative System, PID Control, Wireless Communication, Vehicle Mapping.

This code is based on Arduino C++ language and will be discussing uses in Project of implementing mechanism of Regenerative system, BLDCâ€™s PID control, vehicle mapping.

Following paper presents circuit of the regenerative system, with the rectifier and switching calculation.

Vehicle used in the project is RWD with front steering. Each BLDC will be connected to the batteries and Microprocessor; be charged and powered at same batteries.

PID control will be functioning with the MATLAB showing each function for p, i, d.

And lastly vehicle mapping is made by the data given sensor of acceleration and gyro for x, y, z axis. This data will be integrated twice and be showing 2-dimension trace in the monitor.
