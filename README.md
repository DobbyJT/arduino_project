## üîß Project Overview  
The project utilizes the **Hiwonder Ackermann Steering** system with an **Arduino MEGA** microcontroller, focusing on the following key components:  
- **Regenerative Braking System**: Efficiently recycles kinetic energy back into the battery using a rectifier circuit and switching calculations.  
- **PID Control**: Implements fine-tuned Proportional-Integral-Derivative control for DC motors, ensuring precise synchronization and target speed tracking.  
- **Wireless Communication**: Seamless communication between subsystems for better coordination.  
- **Line Tracing**: Uses servo-controlled steering to follow predefined paths.  

The vehicle is a **Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD)** model with front steering, and all subsystems are designed to interact cohesively to optimize performance and efficiency.
