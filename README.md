# We-the-system

This repository is made for the project 11 team of the Microprocessor Application System Project.

In this project we're using hiwonder ackerman steering with Arduino MEGA.

We'll be doing Regenerative System, PID Control, Wireless Communication, Line Tracing

This code is based on Arduino(C++ language) and will be discussing uses in Project of implementing mechanism of Regenerative system, DC motorâ€™s PID control, Line Tracing

Following paper presents circuit of the regenerative system, with the rectifier and switching calculation.

Vehicle used in the project is RWD with front steering.

Each DC motors will be connected to the batteries and Microprocessor; be charged and powered at same batteries.

PID control will be functioning and show each function for p, i, d.

Since, there are many systems and interrupts, we decided to devide hardware to behave efficiently.

One for activating encoder motor, in order words, chassis and the other for servo motor.

We also put our subsystems and trials in subsystem folder.
